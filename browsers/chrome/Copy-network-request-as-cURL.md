Chrome has a feature which allows you to copy a web request as a curl request, so you see all the various elements of the request on the command line.

Turn on the developer tools in Chrome, make the request, and check the "Network" tab. There I see requests for the page itself and also each of the assets. Right-click on any of the entries there, and you'll see the option to copy the request as curl
