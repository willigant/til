# Year 2038 Problem

Epoch times will reach the 32-bit integer limit on January 19, 2038 (2,147,483,647 seconds after 1 January 1970). Times after that will be stored as a negative number and things will get wild. This is important to note if you're setting up something to "never expire" by adding 20 years or something. Soon, it's going to go past the max 32 bit epoch time and start to be negative -- which could ruin some logic.
